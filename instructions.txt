Using JSON - 5 Practice: Debugging JSON Travel Bookings
05/07/25

Instructions:
You will analyze a JSON file in the software-dev-course-common-errors-in-json
GitHub repo containing multiple syntax errors, identify the issues, and correct them.

Scenario:
You are working as a developer on a team building a travel booking API. One of
your teammates has created a JSON file to represent a hotel booking, but it
contains several syntax errors that prevent it from being parsed. Your task is to
identify and fix these errors.

===== TASKS =====
1. Review the JSON file in the GitHub repo to identify all syntax errors.
2. Correct the JSON file to make it valid.
3. Use a JSON validator to confirm that your corrected file is error-free.
4. List each of the specific corrections you made within comments in your code and explain why they were necessary.

To complete this task, you will also need to follow the instructions to use one of the
following JSON validators:
● JSONLint: https://jsonlint.com/ 
● Code Beautify: https://codebeautify.org/jsonvalidator
