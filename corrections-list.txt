=== A list of the corrections made and why each was necessary ===

- we don't use; remove ===== const invalidBookingJSON = ``;
- missing a comma after checkInDate; add comma ===== "checkInDate": "2024-05-15"
- missing quotations around "name" in; add quotes ===== name: "Alice Johnson",
- misuse of undefined in Bob Smiths age; change to null ===== "age": undefined,
- missing the .com in Bob Smith's email; add .com ===== "email": "bob.smith@example"
- was an extra comma; delete comma ===== "Parking",

üí¨ Reflect and answer the following:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What tools or techniques did you use to identify the errors?
I read through the program slowly to identify any squiggly lines under values.
After identifying WHERE the errors were, I was able to use context clue to determine WHAT the errors were.

2Ô∏è‚É£ How did you confirm that your corrected JSON file was valid?
I confirmed it was valid by using an online validator. 
I pasted my code into the input field and the validator let me know whether it was valid or not.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Which errors were the most difficult to spot? Why?
The most difficult to spot was extra or missing commas because they are so small and seem like such a tiny problem.
Even the "smallest" of problems can wreck the whole program!

4Ô∏è‚É£ What strategies can help you avoid these kinds of errors in the future?
The online validators were very helpful. I missed the error that undefined can't be used in Bobs age.
The online validator brought it to my attention, allowing me to then change undefined to null.
